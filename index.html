                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>My goal revolves around sharpening and effectively using my skills in a competitive environment.
                    Growing as a student and growing along with the institution, that I choose to be a part of, occupy
                    important slots in my list of priorities.</p>

                <h2>Vission</h2>
                <p>I wish to learn from, excel in and go beyond every challenge I face in life. Every opportunity in
                    life, including this one, must be used with diligence and hard work. This, I believe, is the only
                    thing that can help me achieve success</p>

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>I believe that success comes your way if you know where to look for it. For me, the sky has always
                    been the limit. I am an ambitious student, not willing to be held back by mediocre challenges. An
                    institution which is willing to fuel my ambitions and desire for success is the kind of institution
                    I want to belong to</p>

            <h1>Develop</h1>
            <h1>Without Limits</h1>
            <p>What made us decide this? Where did we get these ideas? Often we develop them without any trials or
                proof. They are based in fear or failure, in messages we have been given growing up, or because we have
                let others limits rub off on us.</p>

            <p>The fact of the matter is this, no one can limit you, but you. No boss, no teacher, no partner, no
                colleague. We know our abilities and our worth, and is we are willing to work for them, great things are
                possible.So some advice on how to stop limiting ourselves comes from those who refused to let it happen
                to them.</p>

                <p>WHO announced that the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) arm of the Solidarity Trial to find an effective
                    COVID-19 treatment was being stopped.

                    The trial's Executive Group and principal investigators made the decision based on evidence from the
                    Solidarity trial, UK's Recovery trial and a Cochrane review of other evidence on hydroxychloroquine.

                    Data from Solidarity (including the French Discovery trial data) and the recently announced results
                    from the UK's Recovery trial both showed that hydroxychloroquine does not result in the reduction of
                    mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care.
